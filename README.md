# Sentinel

**Autonomous trust oracle for AI agents on Base.**

Sentinel discovers [ERC-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004) registered agents, verifies their identity and capabilities, privately evaluates trust signals via [Venice](https://venice.ai), and writes verifiable reputation scores on-chain via [EAS](https://attest.org) attestations.

---

## Why

ERC-8004 gave 20,000+ agents on-chain identity. But the Reputation and Validation registries are empty — no product verifies agent identities or populates trust data. MCP has [5+ CVEs](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks) including CVSS 9.6 RCE. A2A Agent Cards are unsigned JSON anyone can forge.

**There is no standardized way for agents to verify each other before interacting.**

Sentinel fixes this by acting as an autonomous trust oracle — discovering agents, evaluating them across 4 dimensions, and publishing verifiable scores that other agents can query.

## Privacy-First Architecture

Sentinel's trust evaluation is designed for **privacy-preserving trust scoring** — the oracle produces verifiable on-chain scores without exposing any agent metadata to third parties.

| Principle | How |
|-----------|-----|
| **Private Inference** | All LLM evaluation runs through [Venice](https://venice.ai)'s policy-based no-data-retention inference. Agent manifests, endpoints, and wallet data are not stored by the LLM provider per Venice's data retention policy (not cryptographically enforced). |
| **No Data Logging** | Venice operates with zero data retention — prompts and completions are discarded after response generation. Sentinel never sends agent data to any other third-party API. |
| **On-chain Transparency** | Trust scores are published as EAS attestations on Base — publicly verifiable, but the raw evaluation inputs remain private. Only the final score, confidence, and dimension breakdown are on-chain. |
| **Local Processing** | Identity verification, liveness checking, and on-chain analysis all run locally. Only the trust synthesis step uses Venice's private LLM. |

This means agents can be evaluated without their owners' data being harvested, stored, or sold — a critical requirement for autonomous agent ecosystems.

### Why Venice Is Essential (Not Optional)

Venice isn't a convenience — it's the only component that can synthesize trust from ambiguous signals. The other three dimensions produce raw metrics (field counts, HTTP codes, tx counts). Venice interprets what those metrics *mean* together.

| Scenario | Without Venice | With Venice |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Agent has valid manifest + live endpoints but 0 tx history | Score: 45, no context | Score: 62 — Venice recognizes a newly deployed but legitimate agent |
| Agent has 500 txs + high balance but broken manifest | Score: 44, no context | Score: 35 — Venice flags the inconsistency as suspicious |
| Agent has secured endpoints (401/403) + partial manifest | Score: 50, ambiguous | Score: 71 — Venice understands that auth-protected APIs are a positive signal |

Removing Venice drops trust scoring to mechanical heuristics that can't distinguish a legitimate new agent from a dormant scam wallet. Venice provides the **interpretive layer** that makes trust scores meaningful — and it does so with zero data retention, ensuring agent privacy is never compromised.

## Why Sentinel Over Alternatives

Other approaches to agent trust exist, but each has a gap Sentinel fills:

| Approach | Limitation | Sentinel's Answer |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Manual curation** (allowlists, directories) | Doesn't scale. 20,000+ ERC-8004 agents can't be hand-reviewed. | Fully autonomous by default — discovers, evaluates, and publishes without human intervention. Human review available via `--interactive` flag for opt-in oversight. |
| **Single-signal scoring** (just check if endpoint responds) | Trivially gameable. A static server returning 200 passes. | 4-dimensional scoring — identity, liveness, on-chain history, and LLM-interpreted trust. Spoofing one dimension doesn't produce a high composite score. |
| **Centralized reputation APIs** | Single point of failure. Provider can censor, manipulate, or go offline. | Scores are published as EAS attestations on Base — immutable, verifiable, and queryable by anyone. |
| **LLM-only evaluation** | Prompt-injectable. Agent manifests could contain adversarial instructions. | Venice input is capped at 4KB and sanitized. LLM score is 30% of composite, not 100% — mechanical checks anchor the evaluation. |
| **Self-reported trust** (agents claim their own scores) | Obvious conflict of interest. | Evaluator wallet is separate from agent owner wallet. Sentinel uses a 3-wallet model to prevent self-scoring. |

| Stage | What happens | Tool |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Discovery** | Scan `Registered` events on the ERC-8004 Identity Registry | web3.py |
| **Verification** | Fetch `agent.json` from URI (HTTPS, IPFS, data:), validate manifest | requests + tenacity |
| **Liveness** | HTTP HEAD each declared service endpoint — 401/403 = secured = good | requests |
| **On-chain** | Wallet tx count, balance, existing reputation — no penalty for new wallets | web3.py |
| **Venice** | Private trust analysis with zero data retention | Venice API (Qwen3-235B) |
| **Publish** | Write score to Reputation Registry + EAS attestation | web3.py |

## Trust Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Identity Completeness | 20% | Manifest fields, services declared, URI resolvable |
| Endpoint Liveness | 20% | Service endpoints responding (200, 401, 403 = alive) |
| On-chain History | 20% | Transaction count, balance, existing reputation, contract code |
| Venice Trust Analysis | 25% | Private risk-categorized LLM evaluation |
| Protocol Declaration | 15% | MCP transport/metadata compliance |

Composite score: 0–100. Bayesian confidence determines auto-publish vs withhold. Weights are env-configurable (`WEIGHT_IDENTITY`, `WEIGHT_LIVENESS`, `WEIGHT_ONCHAIN`, `WEIGHT_VENICE_TRUST`, `WEIGHT_PROTOCOL`).

**Weight Rationale:** Identity (20%) is most gameable. Liveness and on-chain (20% each) require real infrastructure. Venice (25%) is highest because it synthesizes all signals and performs risk-categorized analysis. Protocol compliance (15%) is binary — lowest weight.

```

### Agent-to-Agent Verification

Sentinel exposes trust tools via two transports:

**MCP (stdio)** — for local agent-to-agent verification:

| MCP Tool | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `verify_agent` | Full trust verification pipeline |
| `check_reputation` | Read reputation from ERC-8004 Reputation Registry |
| `check_validation` | Check Validation Registry status |
| `get_trust_chain` | Score, confidence, timestamp, attestation UID |
| `compute_transitive_trust` | Derived trust when one agent vouches for another |

```python
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

async with stdio_client(StdioServerParameters(
    command="python3", args=["mcp_server.py"]
)) as (read, write):
    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
        await session.initialize()
        result = await session.call_tool("verify_agent", {"agent_id": 42})
```

**HTTP API** — for remote access (deployed on Railway):

| HTTP Endpoint | MCP Equivalent |
|---------------|----------------|
| `POST /api/evaluate` | `verify_agent` |
| `GET /api/reputation/{id}` | `check_reputation` |
| `GET /api/trust-chain/{id}` | `get_trust_chain` |
| `POST /api/transitive-trust` | `compute_transitive_trust` |

MCP requires stdio transport (local execution). The HTTP API provides the same functionality for remote agents and the interactive dashboard.

A trust-gated demo client is included — run `python3 dummy_client_agent.py --agent-id 1`.

## Known Limitations & Future Work

| Area | Current State | Next Step |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Liveness checking** | HTTP HEAD/GET per endpoint — verifies reachability and auth status. | Add TLS certificate validation, response schema checks, and semantic verification (does the endpoint behave like an AI agent or just return 200?). |
| **Sybil resistance** | Separate evaluator wallet prevents self-scoring, but a determined attacker could register many agents. | Weight reputation by evaluator stake or use attestation graphs to detect evaluation rings. |
| **Discovery scale** | Scans `Registered` events via `eth_getLogs` — O(n blocks). | Migrate to a Graph Protocol subgraph for instant historical queries. |
| **Venice model dependency** | Tied to Qwen3-235B via Venice. | Abstract the LLM layer to support model rotation and multi-model consensus scoring. |

## Development History

Sentinel was developed during the [Synthesis Hackathon](https://synthesis.md/) (March 2026) by Gayathri Satheesh with Claude Code as the AI engineering assistant. The project evolved from an earlier prototype called AQE (Agent Quality Evaluator) that targeted smart contract evaluation — the core pipeline architecture (discover → verify → analyze → score → publish) was adapted for agent trust evaluation when the ERC-8004 opportunity became clear.

The full development conversation log is available in [`CONVERSATION_LOG.md`](CONVERSATION_LOG.md).
